Password Generator

This website modifies a starter code to create an application that enables employees to generate random passwords based on criteria that they’ve selected. This app runs in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It has a clean and polished, responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes. Users are given the option to choose a length between 8 and 128 characters, uppercase or lowercase letters, special characters, and/or numbers.

The website can be found here: https://dasiasmith.github.io/Password-Generator/
